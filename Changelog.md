# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. In chronological order with the newest changes first.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- v1.1 Brazilian Portuguese translation.

### Changed

- Use frontmatter title & description in each language version template

### Removed

- Trademark sign previously shown after the project description in version 
0.3.0

## [0.0.1] - 2014-05-31

### Added

- Github and git project initalized.
- This CHANGELOG file to hopefully serve as an evolving example of a
  standardized open source project CHANGELOG.
- README initialized.
- test_Matrix_info.py initialized as first BiTri file.
- pytest_Matrix_info.py created as pytest file.

### Changed

- Refer to a "change log" instead of a "CHANGELOG" throughout the site
  to differentiate between the file and the purpose of the file â€” the
  logging of changes.

### Removed

- Remove empty sections from CHANGELOG, they occupy too much space and
  create too much noise in the file. People will have to assume that the
  missing sections were intentionally left out because they contained no
  notable changes.
